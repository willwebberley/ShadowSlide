ShadowSlide
===========

Simple example of displaying a slideshow in a web page with an internal shadow.

This can give the effect of a frame by giving the images depth.


The example on here is a carousel-style slideshow, though this can easily be modified for any other type (such as fading).


REQUIREMENTS:

JQuery base
JQuery easing plugin (for this example)
